## Introduction 📋

> The Vigenere cipher, like other contemporary cryptographic ciphers, uses something called a tabula recta, a grid of alphabetic characters where encoders can shift lines for alphabetic substitution. This basic strategy is also part of the Trithemius cipher, and the Caesar cipher, named after Julius Caesar.

> Instead of doing a consistent shift alphabetically, the Vigenere shifts letters according to a repeating keyword, which serves to make the encryption more complex and more difficult to decode.

> As a "transposition" code or a code involving the substitution of alphabetic letters, the Vigenere cipher represented an improvement from codes that simply shifted letters consistently. These primitive codes were easy to break through processes like letter frequency. Still, even the Vigenere code is not considered a very strong code, and is easily broken with modern tools.

## Features ✨

* Encryption and Decryption of any text.
* Support Keys of variable length.

## Install 🔧

```
git clone https://github.com/iluzioDev/vigenere-cipher
cd vigenere-cipher
python3 vigenere-cipher.py
```

## Usage 💡

Once started, a menu will prompt allowing to decide the use of the encryption or the decryption. Once the option is selected, it requires the text to encrypt/decrypt and the key used.
